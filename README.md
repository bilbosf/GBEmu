# GBEmu
A WIP Nintendo Game Boy emulator made for educational purposes. This project is heavily inspired and based on the code from the [NES emulator by OLC](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES). I am using information from several sources, most of which can be found on the [GBdev Awesome List](https://gbdev.io/list.html).

This project does not intend to be an extremely accurate or fast emulation of the Game Boy, but an easy to understand attempt at decent, playable emulation.

Right now, I am working on emulating the CPU.
